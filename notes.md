My name is Alejandra, and I'm studying an FP at **IES Balmis** to become a software developer. I love animals, videogames, fantasy fiction, plants and decorating my home.
My favorite videogame is Baldur's Gate 3. I'm currently playing Elden Ring, and sometimes also Dragon Ball FighterZ and Baldur's Gate: Enhaced Edition.
I also like anime. I'm currently watching Rurouni Kenshin (the 2016 series). My favorite animes are Evangelion, Dragon Ball and Berserk.
I have an orange cat named Alan :cat2: (he's living with my parents in Argentina) and a hamster here in Alicante, called Anakina :hamster:
